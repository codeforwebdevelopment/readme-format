ðŸš€ **AngularQuery Built with Signals: Ready for a Zoneless Angular Future!** ðŸš€

AngularQuery, the powerful state management library for Angular, has been fully built using **#signals** â€” making it inherently **prepared for zoneless Angular**. This approach eliminates the need for zones in Angular, enabling more predictable and efficient change detection.

### Why is this exciting?

âœ… **Performance**: Signals offer fine-grained reactivity, leading to faster updates and less overhead compared to traditional change detection methods. 

âœ… **Simplicity**: By moving away from zones, AngularQuery makes it easier to work with a more declarative style of reactive programming. This means cleaner, more maintainable code with fewer side effects.

âœ… **Zoneless Angular**: Angularâ€™s future is headed toward a more *zone-less* world, and AngularQuery is ahead of the curve. With signals, it seamlessly integrates with Angularâ€™s evolving architecture, ensuring smooth compatibility as the framework transitions to a more efficient, zone-less change detection model.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Signal-based architecture**: Optimized for scalability and responsiveness.
- **Zoneless readiness**: Future-proof and performance-oriented for Angular applications.
- **Cleaner state management**: Improved reactivity without the need for zones.

Whether you're building new apps or refactoring old ones, AngularQuery is your go-to tool for a zoneless Angular ecosystem! ðŸ”¥
