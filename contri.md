**Title: Implementing ngx-loading-buttons with Angular Material for a Seamless UI Experience**

If you're building an Angular application and looking for an intuitive way to show loading states on buttons, `ngx-loading-buttons` is a fantastic solution. In this post, I'll walk you through how to integrate it into your Angular app with Angular Material for a smooth, responsive user interface.

---

### 1. **What is ngx-loading-buttons?**
`ngx-loading-buttons` is an Angular package designed to enhance buttons with loading indicators. It offers a seamless way to display spinner icons or loading states when actions are being processed, providing a more user-friendly experience. This is especially useful in forms, API calls, and any other processes that might take time.

---

### 2. **Prerequisites**
Before you get started, make sure you have the following:
- Angular project set up with Angular Material.
- Basic knowledge of Angular and Material components.

---

### 3. **Installation**

To use `ngx-loading-buttons`, you'll need to install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install ngx-loading-buttons --save
```

Also, ensure that you've installed Angular Material:

```bash
ng add @angular/material
```

---

### 4. **Importing Modules**

In your `app.module.ts`, import the necessary modules for both `ngx-loading-buttons` and Angular Material.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
import { NgxLoadingButtonModule } from 'ngx-loading-buttons';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    MatButtonModule,
    NgxLoadingButtonModule
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

---

### 5. **Usage in the Template**

Once you've installed the module and imported it, you're ready to use it in your template. Here’s an example of how to create a Material button with a loading state:

```html
<button mat-raised-button
        [ngxLoading]="isLoading"
        (click)="onButtonClick()"> 
  Submit
</button>
```

In this example:
- `mat-raised-button` is an Angular Material button.
- `[ngxLoading]="isLoading"` binds the loading state to the `isLoading` variable.
- `(click)="onButtonClick()"` triggers the function to handle button click.

---

### 6. **Component Logic**

In your component, you'll control the loading state. Here's a simple example:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  isLoading = false;

  onButtonClick() {
    this.isLoading = true;
    // Simulate an API call or action
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.isLoading = false;
    }, 3000); // Simulate 3 seconds of loading
  }
}
```

Here:
- `isLoading` controls whether the loading spinner is visible.
- The `onButtonClick` method simulates an API call and toggles `isLoading`.

---

### 7. **Customizing the Button**

You can customize the button in various ways. For example, you can change the color, spinner type, or text inside the button. Here’s an example:

```html
<button mat-raised-button
        [ngxLoading]="isLoading"
        [ngxLoadingType]="'circle'"
        [ngxLoadingColor]="'accent'"
        (click)="onButtonClick()"> 
  Submit
</button>
```

- `[ngxLoadingType]="'circle'"` – This changes the spinner to a circular style.
- `[ngxLoadingColor]="'accent'"` – You can modify the spinner color to match the Material theme.

---

### 8. **Conclusion**

`ngx-loading-buttons` is an excellent tool for adding loading indicators to buttons in your Angular applications. Paired with Angular Material, it makes the UI more interactive and user-friendly. The integration is straightforward, and the customization options give you flexibility for your design needs.

I hope this guide helps you get started! Don't hesitate to explore more advanced configurations and styling options to fully integrate loading states into your Angular applications.
